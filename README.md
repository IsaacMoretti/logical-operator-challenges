🧠 Logical Operators in JavaScript – My Learning Journey
📝 About This Guide
I'm learning about logical operators, so I'll document all my challenges and experiments here.

🎯 Challenge 1: The Trusted Messenger
Goal:  You're building a notification system. 
// If the user has a preferred email, use it; 
// otherwise use the secondary email. 
// If neither exists, send to the emergency email.

🎯 Challenge 2: Secret Portal
Goal: The portal opens if and only if the player satisfies at least one criterion.

🎯 Challenge 3: TheSurprisebonus
Goal:  Determines free shipping eligibility based on:
// VIP status (case-insensitive "yes")
// Order total (>= $200)
// Active promotion flag

 🎯 Challenge 4: The Mysterious Name
// A system collects user names, but some fields may be empty ("", null, undefined).
// If the name is invalid, you should use:
// The user's nickname (if it exists)
// Otherwise, "Guest" + random number
// How to do this with ||?

 🎯 Challenge 5: The Voice Assistant
// A virtual assistant responds with:
// The custom response from the database, OR
// The default system response, OR
// Silence (if nothing is found).


(Future challenges can follow the same format!)

📝 About This Guide
I'm documenting my experiments with logical operators (|| and &&) through practical challenges.

📝 OR (||) Challenges
🎯 Challenge 1: The Trusted Messenger
Goal: Build a notification system that:
// Uses the user’s preferred email if available,
// Falls back to their secondary email,
// Defaults to an emergency email if neither exists.

// An active promotion is running.

🎯 Challenge 4: The Mysterious Name
Goal: Handle invalid names ("", null, undefined) by using:
// The user’s nickname (if valid),
// Otherwise, assign "Guest" + random number.
(How to solve this with ||?)

Goal: Respond with:
// A custom response from the database,
