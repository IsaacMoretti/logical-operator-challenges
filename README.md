🧠 Logical Operators in JavaScript – My Learning Journey
📝 About This Guide
I'm learning about logical operators, so I'll document all my challenges and experiments here.

🎯 Challenge 1: The Trusted Messenger
Goal: * You're building a notification system. 
    * - If the user has a preferred email, use it; 
    * - otherwise use the secondary email. 
    * - If neither exists, send to the emergency email.

🎯 Challenge 2: Secret Portal
Goal: The portal opens if and only if the player satisfies at least one criterion.

🎯 Challenge 3: TheSurprisebonus
Goal: * Determines free shipping eligibility based on:
 * - VIP status (case-insensitive "yes")
 * - Order total (>= $200)
 * - Active promotion flag

(Future challenges can follow the same format!)
